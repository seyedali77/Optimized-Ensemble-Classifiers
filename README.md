# Optimized Ensemble Methods for Model Deployment

This repository contains custom Python implementations of two optimized ensemble classifiers:
- **OptimizedBaggingClassifier**
- **OptimizedBoostingClassifier**

These classes are designed to accelerate model training and deployment while enhancing model accuracy and robustness. They leverage parallel processing, bootstrap sampling, and adaptive weight updating to deliver state-of-the-art performance in production settings.

## Overview

### OptimizedBaggingClassifier
- **Parallel Training:** Utilizes `joblib.Parallel` to train multiple base estimators concurrently.
- **Bootstrap Sampling:** Implements random sampling with replacement to reduce variance.
- **Flexibility:** Allows integration with any scikit-learn compatible base estimator.

### OptimizedBoostingClassifier
- **Adaptive Weighting:** Adjusts sample weights iteratively to focus on hard-to-classify instances.
- **Learning Rate:** Provides control over each estimatorâ€™s influence.
- **Binary Classification:** Implements an AdaBoost-like mechanism for improved accuracy.

## Features

- **Speed & Efficiency:** Parallel processing accelerates the training phase.
- **Robustness:** Bootstrap sampling and adaptive boosting improve model generalization.
- **Extensibility:** Easily plug in any base estimator from scikit-learn.
- **Deployment Ready:** Optimized for real-world scenarios with enhanced performance and accuracy.
